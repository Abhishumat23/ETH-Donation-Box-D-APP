# Donation Box dApp - Project File Overview

This file explains the purpose and function of every file in your ETH-Donation-Box-D-APP project.

---

## Top-Level Files

- **README.md**: Main documentation. Explains project setup, usage, and technical details.
- **COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md**: Final summary of project deliverables, features, and testing results.
- **GITHUB_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step guide for publishing the project to GitHub securely.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files/folders to exclude from Git (e.g., node_modules, .env, build artifacts).
- **.env.example**: Template for environment variables. Never commit real secrets.
- **package.json**: Node.js project config. Lists dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
- **package-lock.json**: Auto-generated file for locking dependency versions.
- **hardhat.config.js**: Hardhat configuration for Solidity compiler, networks, and plugins.
- **setup.sh**: Bash script for quick setup, compilation, and testing.

---

## Smart Contract

- **contracts/DonationBox.sol**: Solidity smart contract. Handles ETH donations, tracks donor totals, and provides stats functions.

---

## Testing & Scripts

- **test/DonationBox.test.js**: Automated unit tests for the smart contract using Hardhat, Mocha, and Chai.
- **scripts/deploy.js**: Script to deploy the DonationBox contract to the local Hardhat blockchain.
- **scripts/test-contract.js**: Script to interact with the deployed contract and demonstrate/test its functions without MetaMask.

---

## Frontend (User Interface)

- **frontend/index.html**: Main landing page (demo portal). Explains project, links to test results and interactive dApp.
- **frontend/demo-index.html**: Original demo portal (backup).
- **frontend/index-interactive.html**: Full interactive dApp interface (requires MetaMask).
- **frontend/index-redirect.html**: Redirect page (not used as main index).
- **frontend/test-results.html**: Displays contract test results and proof of functionality (no MetaMask needed).
- **frontend/styles.css**: CSS file for all frontend pages. Handles layout, colors, and responsive design.
- **frontend/app.js**: JavaScript logic for the interactive dApp. Handles MetaMask connection, donation transactions, and UI updates.

---

## Build Artifacts (Auto-generated)

- **artifacts/**: Contains compiled contract files and ABI (used by frontend/scripts to interact with the contract).
- **cache/**: Hardhat build cache (auto-generated).

---

## Project Structure Summary

- **Smart Contract**: `contracts/DonationBox.sol` (core logic)
- **Testing**: `test/DonationBox.test.js`, `scripts/test-contract.js`
- **Deployment**: `scripts/deploy.js`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/` (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Config & Docs**: `README.md`, `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `hardhat.config.js`, `setup.sh`
- **Artifacts/Cache**: Auto-generated by Hardhat

## How It All Works Together

1. **Smart contract** is written in Solidity and deployed to a local blockchain (Hardhat).
2. **Testing scripts** verify the contract works as expected.
3. **Frontend** provides a user interface for donations and stats, connecting to the blockchain via MetaMask and Web3.js.
4. **Documentation** guides users through setup, usage, and security best practices.
5. **GitHub setup** ensures safe publishing with no sensitive data.
